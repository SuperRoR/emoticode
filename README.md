# EmotiCODE v2.0 [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/evilsocket/emoticode.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/evilsocket/emoticode)

This is the code repository for [emoticode.net](http://www.emoticode.net/).
It's a complete rewrite of the original website, which was written in PHP, in **Ruby on Rails** using MySQL
as DBMS and all the Rails magic.
I've started this new version to learn Rails advanced concepts, but I'm still a new comer in this world so if you find any bug or bad practice please feel free to open an issue here on GitHub.

## About

EmotiCODE is a collaborative source code snippets aggregator and search engine but mostly a place where developers can find the answers they are searching for and contribute with their own
contents to help others with the same needs.
The main concept behind emoticode is "as a developer i own a lot to people publishing source codes, snippets and guides on the internet, the less i can do is do my best to help the internet back",
therefore we encourage people to register ( the process is pretty straightforward ) and post every bit of code they have/use/find on the internet, because even the smallest three-line-snippet could
solve someone else problems while developing a project ... you never know :)
